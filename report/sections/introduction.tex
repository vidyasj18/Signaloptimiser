\section{Background and Significance}
\label{sec:background}

Urban traffic congestion poses a critical challenge in rapidly growing Indian cities like Mangalore, where mixed traffic conditions and ever-increasing vehicle ownership rates strain existing road infrastructure. Intersections serve as major potential bottlenecks, and inefficiencies in their operation often lead to increased travel delays, higher fuel consumption, elevated emission levels, and reduced safety for all road users. Conventional traffic signal plans, whether outdated or based on intuition rather than data, fail to cope with dynamically fluctuating demand patterns, resulting in unpredictable traffic flow and commuter frustration.

This project addresses these concerns by introducing a systematic, data-driven methodology for optimizing signal timings at key urban intersections. By employing a combination of automated field data collection using YOLOv8 computer vision for vehicle detection and counting, standard engineering practices (Webster's method), and SUMO microsimulation for validation, the study generates precise signal plans tailored to real-world traffic conditions. The significance of this project lies not only in its immediate improvements—such as reduced vehicle delays and better intersection throughput—but also in its demonstration of how modern tools and best practices can be effectively adapted for Indian urban environments. The project offers a replicable and scalable model through a user-friendly Streamlit web application, enabling accessible traffic signal optimization for other cities aiming to move from reactive to proactive, evidence-based traffic signal management, ultimately supporting safer, more efficient, and sustainable urban mobility.

\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:problem}

Urban intersections in Mangalore consistently struggle with severe congestion, prolonged vehicle delays, and erratic traffic flow. These challenges are largely attributed to suboptimal signal timings and the reliance on manual signal control, which tends to be inconsistent and unable to adapt to real-time traffic fluctuations. Existing signal plans, where they exist, are often outdated and fail to reflect the evolving patterns of traffic demand, resulting in mixed and unpredictable vehicular movements.

As a consequence, road users regularly experience poor intersection throughput, longer wait times, and increased frustration. These inefficiencies also contribute to higher emissions from idling vehicles, wasted fuel, and compromised safety for drivers, commuters, and pedestrians. The absence of a reliable, data-driven foundation for intersection management perpetuates these issues, making it difficult for local authorities to provide efficient and equitable urban mobility.

    \item Selection and classification of two critical urban intersections in Mangalore for detailed study (Jyoti Circle and Hampankatta Circle)

\section{Scope and Limitations of the Project}
\label{sec:scope_limitations}

\subsection{Scope of the Project}

The scope of this project encompasses the detailed study, analysis, and optimization of traffic signal timings at two critical urban intersections in Mangalore. It covers comprehensive field data collection using both manual counts and modern video analytics to accurately quantify traffic volumes and movement patterns. The project applies standard traffic engineering methodologies, such as Webster's formula, alongside machine learning models to design and recommend optimal signal cycles and green splits tailored to each site. Furthermore, it involves the creation of visualization tools—including signal phasing diagrams and charts—to clearly communicate proposed improvements. The project's recommendations are intended to serve as a replicable framework for similar intersections facing congestion issues and provide actionable insights for local authorities seeking effective, data-driven traffic management solutions.

\subsection{Limitations of the Project}

Several limitations constrain the outcomes of this project. The study is restricted to only two intersections within the city, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to all urban situations in Mangalore. Field data was collected over a limited time period and may not fully capture seasonal, weekly, or special-event fluctuations in traffic patterns. Equipment constraints, weather-related disruptions, and occasional manual measurement errors could also have influenced the accuracy of certain observations. Additionally, the scope for implementing and testing adaptive real-time signal control was limited due to resource and time constraints; as a result, recommendations are based on periodic data analysis rather than on dynamic, continuous traffic monitoring. External factors—such as pedestrian behavior, unauthorized street usage, and enforcement of traffic rules—were considered only to the extent observable during the field study, and may affect the practical impact of the proposed signal changes.
